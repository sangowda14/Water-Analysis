Water Quality Analysis and Evaluation
This project analyzes water quality parameters to assess suitability for irrigation, drinking, and industrial use using machine learning models and Python libraries.

Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of chemical properties
- Classification of water samples using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- Visualization of feature impact using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset
- Public dataset of water samples with chemical parameters like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, etc.
